          The Fedora project combines the 
          benefits of Red Hat engineering 
          with the freedom and flexibility 
          of a community-based distro. The latest 
          Fedora offers advances such as new 
          tools, improved looks, and better security. We are proud to bring you Fedora 8 
          as this month's Linux Magazine DVD.

          new Nodoka Gnome theme is also included. OpenOffice 2.3 comes with 
          major improvements to Chart, enhancements to the Base report writer, and new 
          features for extension developers.
          The Compiz Fusion 3D compositing 
          window manager - which merges the 
          Compiz and Beryl 3D windowing tools - 
          provides stunning 3D effects. You'll also 
          find new power-management features 
          and better support for laptops. Network 
          Manager 0.7 offers better wireless network management. 
          Multimedia improvements include default support for the PulseAudio sound 
          server and CodecBuddy, a tool for helping users navigate the maze of open and 
          proprietary multimedia formats.
        </p>
        <h2>Packages</h2>
        <p>
          Fedora provides a comprehensive package-management system for installing 
          and updating applications. The yum 
          package tool offers efficient installation 
          from the command line, and Pirut lets 
          you manage packages from the graphic 
          desktop. The Pup updater automatically 
          looks for package updates. The latest Fedora comes with performance enhancements for yum, as well as new features 
          for Pirut.
        </p>
        <h2>Security Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Fedora's advanced security tools are evidence of its Red Hat parentage. Support

          for the SELinux mandatory access control system and execution control features such as No eXecute and Position 
          Independent Executables (PIE) are included in Fedora 8. Fedora also offers 
          support for ELF data hardening, buffer 
          overflow detection, and restricted kernel 
          memory access. 
          FORTIFY_SOURCE, which prevents 
          many common security exploits, has 
          been enhanced to support C++. The SELinux version included with Fedora 8 
          comes with additional improvements, 
          such as new Kiosk support and several 
          security policy updates.
          Red Hat's security emphasis is reflected in other applications and components throughout the Fedora 8 environment. For instance, Fedora comes with 
          new secure remote-management capabilities for virtualization tools such as 
          Xen, KVM, and Qemu. The graphical 
          firewall configuration tool systemconfig-firewall is also inside.

        <h2>Try It!</h2>
        <p>
          Red Hat engineers and an active open 
          source development community help to 
          make Fedora 8 a feature-rich, userfriendly distribution with everything you 
          need to access the web, create office 
          documents, play music and videos, 
          manage photos, play games, and more. 
          We hope you enjoy this month's Linux 
           Magazine DVD.
